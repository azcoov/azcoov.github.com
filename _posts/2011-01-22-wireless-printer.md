For the two times each year that I print...

This is one of those things with a high WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor). She likes to print, and I like gadgets.

I guess my favorite thing about this printer is that it let me register an email address that I can send to and it will automatically print whatever I send it! You know for those two times I print each year.

It took 10 minutes or so to set up. Windows took forever to install the print driver. Of course AirPrint worked instantly and flawlessly from the iPhones & iPads.
