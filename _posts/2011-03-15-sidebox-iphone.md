title: "SideBox for iPhone"
excerpt:
  I've been working on the iPhone app for SideBox for the last couple of weeks. It's been fun, challenging, and engaging. I'm really beginning to understand Git, GitHub, and what social coding is all about. I'm using an open-source library called MonoTouch and MonoTouch.Dialog to write this app. I'll write more about MonoTouch later. The quick-pitch on MonoTouch is that is allows us poor .NET developers to get in on the iPhone (and Android via MonoDroid) action. MonoTouch.Dialog, to quote Miguel de Icaza, takes the "administrivia" out of building views and lets you focus on getting things done.

Here is a taste of what we are building, from the SideBox blog:

We have a road map for features that we want to launch with and I will touch on those in another post. For now, here is a quick-list of features we think you'll love:

Dashboard - Simple and to the point. This is your mobile command center. You'll always have a pulse on what's important to you; Alerts, Follow-ups, and Tasks. You can stop letting leads slip through the cracks now. 
Customers - You'll always have your contacts with you in a familiar interface. You can add customers on the fly, do fast look-ups by name, even call and email them right from the app.
Documents - You can manage your estimates and invoices right from the app. Email, Fax, or Print an estimate or invoice right from your phone.
GPS - Google is hungry and we've got the food they want. SideBox for the iPhone will power hyper-local search for your business.
Pictures - Open an estimate or invoice, snap a pic, done. It's that easy. Really!
