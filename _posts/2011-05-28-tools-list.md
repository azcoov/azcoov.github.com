title: "Tools list for the mac and windows programmers"
excerpt:
  I'm a big fan of Scott Hanselman's Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Windows. It's my go-to page whenever I get a new machine. But I'm no longer a Windows guy. I'm a Macdows guy. I still code C# .Net (with Mono) on the mac, but a lot of these tools are cross-platform.

I'm a big fan of Scott Hanselman's [Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/tools). It's my go-to page whenever I get a new machine. But I'm no longer a Windows guy. I'm a Macdows guy. I
still code C# .Net (with Mono) on the mac, but a lot of these tools are cross-platform.

I just got a new setup to complete my [indi-developer work station](http://blog.coovtech.com/indy-office). I'm running the new iMac with a LED Cinema connected to it. I used to boot into Windows 7 when I needed to work on [SideBox](http://www.sidebox.com) or other contracting work, and boot into OS X when I needed to code iPhone or do school or anything else. This time around I've gone virtual with Parallels. I run Windows 7 Pro as a VM. This way I'm running both OS X and Windows 7 at the same time. In fact, Parallels has this coherence mode where it runs your windows applications as if they were part of the OS X environment. It's slick!

Anyway, as I was setting up my new work station, I wanted document the apps I was installing. I thought my list would be massive, like Scott's, but it turns out I use two applications about 99% of the time and don't really screw around with much else.

Here is the breakdown of what I installed for OS X, Windows 7, and both:

**OS X**

[Sparrow](http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/) - I hate email and that's why I love Sparrow. Simple minimal design, works with iMap, Mac look & feel.

[Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) - Let's me run Windows 7 & Ubuntu VM's. Better than VMWare Fusion.

[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) ([MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com/), [MonoTouch](http://monotouch.net/), [MonoTouch.Dialog](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog)) - Build iPhone and iPad apps with C#. Nuff said.

[HttpClient](http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/) - Simple HTTP tester

[Twitter for Mac](http://blog.twitter.com/2011/01/twitter-for-mac.html) - Clean, simple, minimal, my favorite Twitter client

[Textmate](http://macromates.com/) - Started to dabble with Ruby on Rails, heard Textmate would get me there without having Visual Studio withdrawls

[TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) - It's like [intellisense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense) for everything

[Gitbox](http://www.gitboxapp.com/) - If you want to leave the terminal, this is the best GUI for Git on the mac

[Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - I like to dabble with other non- Microsoft technologies

**Windows 7**

[Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/home) - MVC, WPF, and Windows Phone 7 stuff

[NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) - Ruby Gems for the .NET world

[Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/) - Best compare and FTP tool on this planet

SQL 2008 Dev - Datebase, duh

[Web Matrix](http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/) - New Microsoft tool for building basic websites, fast. Razor + MVC + Templates

[MVC3](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3) + [Razor](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx) - Leave web forms in the dust

[Notepad ++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Because notepad and textpad suck

[Storm](http://storm.codeplex.com/) - Best tool for testing web services

**Both**

[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) - Best browser. Debugging not as good as Firebug, but it's good

[DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/) - Can't live without it. Love the folder sharing

[LastPass + XMarks](http://blog.lastpass.com/2010/12/lastpass-acquires-xmarks.html) - Sick of typing in passwords?

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) + [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Contribute to open-source. Also great for just backing-up side projects

[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) + [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - Another DVCS like Git

[JSONViewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) - JSON is nasty to look at in big chunks

[Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) - Brain in the cloud

[Pixlr](http://pixlr.com/) - Awesome cloud image editor

[Skype](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home) - Must have for collaboration

[AgileZen](http://agilezen.com/) - I visualize projects in kanban

[Basecamp & Campfire](http://37signals.com/) - Must have if you work on a team

I'll try to keep this list fresh for OS X and Windows devs as I find new tools.
