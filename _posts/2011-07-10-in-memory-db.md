When I hear people throw around terms like "web scale", or "acid", I usually face-palm &amp; think of that [MongoDB vs SQL](http://www.google.com/m/url?client=safari&amp;ei=HI4aTsDPJMeS8gbel4SlAw&amp;hl=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/6995033/mongo-db-is-web-scale&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAcBU1BzsQMp0MUGgV5yC0aAAN7Q) extra normal video. 

I can't wait to see "newsql" but I would love for someone to explain how Bing has accomplished "web scale" with MVC3 &amp; SQL. It seems to negate claims such as this.
