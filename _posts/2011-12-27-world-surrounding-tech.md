So what the heck are these little things?

##Frame Hangers?

Today I put up Crystal's new double diploma frame in our office. Before I started I went to the garage and grabbed my supply of things men buy at the Home Depot but don't really need. I started with my automatic stud finder, then used a laser level, then grabbed a nail that I would carefully press into the wall to make divot marks that I would use for driving my nails through.

Then I came across this piece of paper. It's something most men are oblivious of but I looked at it. It was instructions. O_o - yeah I read it and to my surprise, it came with these two little plastic impressions, and a tiny stick-on level, that make hanging the frame incredibly simple. No need for a laser level, or a nail for marking where your mounts will go. These two little plastic pieces take care of it all.

You simply slide them into the wall mounts on the back of the frame, place the frame where you want it, and press lightly. These little plastic pieces have a sharp point at their center that leave you with perfectly aligned divots. Just drive in your nails and call it a day.

Knowing how often I hang things (about once every 5 years), this probably isn't something new and cool. I just really appreicated the simplicity of these things. It's not too common these days to find highly functional things that aren't sold in an AppStore; at least in my world surrounded by geekdom.
