Audious Posterous

Like every other web programmer out there, I built my own website that ultimatley became a blog engine. I wrote it in asp.net 1.1 I think. Then 2.0. Then 3.5. Then I re-wrote it in asp.net MVC 1, then MVC 2. Then I re-wrote it again in Rails 3. Then I re-wrote it again in MVC with Razor. I may have even done a version with WebMatrix.

Sound familiar? The cool thing about doing this again-and-again is that I was able to build a cool product from most of the code I had accumiulated over the years. It's called [Tekfolio](www.tekfolio.me) and it's a cool site for programmers to create online geek portfolios of interesting things they've built. I guess you can say it's like Dribbble for engineers...

Anyway, there was a fundenmental problem with having a .net blog engine. If I wantted to make a change to it, tweak it, hack on it, whetever, I had to be on a Windows box running Visual Studio and Sql Server Management Studio. Well, I don't develop entirley on the Windows stack anymore. I don't even own a PC anymore, so my .net blog had to go.

To be fair, I do run Windows in Bootcamp and in Parallels. I still feed my family via .net contract work. My Startup runs very well on the Windows stack. I haven't jumped ship. I just have Apple products now and I'm running some flavor os iOS/OS X more than Windows. It's hard to break my MB Air from my hands and I don't run Windows on it so it just made sense to kill the .net blog engine.

So I did. Sorta...

I still keep it around. I runs source code examples from prior blog entires. Nothing worse than a blog post with a "click for live example" that doesn't work.

I took the Rails version of my blog and was going to live with that. With rails, I could manage my code base from OS X or Windows if I needed to. It's more of a code-anywhere-you-please type of web development and I love that. The problem was that my rails blog engine wasn't feature complete and I didn't have the time to add all the things I wanted in the engine.

So I created a Posterous account, pointed my DNS to it, and BOOM! - sexy new blog.

##Posterous is great!

There are three things in particular that I `LOVE` about posterous:
* You can email posts
* It supports Markdown
* You can email posts in Markdown!!!

And so that's what I've been doing for what seems like two years or so. But, I still have that hacker itch. I want to tweek the engine. I want to re-arange things. I still don't have the time to hack on a blog engine but my passion for it persists.

##GitHub

What the heck does GitHub have to do with this blog post? Well, first of all, it's my first post on the GitHub engine. That's right, I'm moving, yet again, to a new blog platform. It's nothing against Posterous. They are still great. I have a few more blogs on Posterous that aren't going anywhere but my personal blog is gonzo.

So GitHub released GitHub Pages a while back and I completly ignored it until a couple of days ago. It's a shame too because I spend so much time on GitHub that it seems natural that I would have jumped all over it back at launch.

##Why GitHub Pages?

Free website hosting with a killer Markdown engine, built-in source control, javascript support, style support, and a host of other neat tricks that I love. Mostly because I've wanted a Markdown Blog Engine in the Cloud with version control and that's what I have now. It's not a blog engine, it's a website engine that just happens to be great for hosting blog posts.
