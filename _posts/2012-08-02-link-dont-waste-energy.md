A great talk from [Scott Hanselman](http://twitter.com/shanselman) about keys to being more productive. I really appreciate the conversation about inbox processing. Not just your email inbox, but your life inbox. My favorite part of the talk is around 22:30 into the video where Scott quotes [David Allen](https://twitter.com/GTDGuy): "Don't put energy into things you don't want more of". I always find it interesting to get insight from the minds of people who are way busier than I am.
