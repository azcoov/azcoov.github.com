*If you are a startup, and you're not incubated, you suck, right?*

When I first took the plundge into the crazy world of starting my own business I had this narrow-minded vision that I needed join an incubation program in order to be successful. After-all, how the heck is a software engineer supposed to get out there and rub elbows with industry folks for whoam he's building software for? That's right, if you are an engineer, and you are building a thing, and you need users for that thing so that you can make money, you have to talk to REAL people about that thing and see REAL people touch that thing. In the REAL-world, you can't just write code and hope everything just magically works out. 

TechStars, and a few others, were obviously on my MUST HAVE list of places that I had to get in to. But how do you get in to a startup incubator? What the hell is an incubator anyway?

You'll find a lot of opinions of what a startup incubator is, or what it should be. Different people are going to find different value in incubators. A CEO business/sales type person will find value in a different way than an engineer would.

##What Incubation Means To Me

It's actually quite simple. Incubation is about knowledge sharing. You have mentors, and mentees, sorta. 

I don't ever want to be in a situation where I'm surrounded by people who can't learn anything from me. Perhaps they might be ok with sharring a bunch of knowledge without any in return, but I'm not ok with that.
