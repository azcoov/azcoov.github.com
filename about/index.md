This is the personal site of Billy Coover - software engineer, entrepreneur, and sports nut. I build desktop, web, and mobile applications for businesses of all sizes.

##Background

From mid 2005, through now, I've been building award winning enterprise desktop, mobile, and web applications. In April of 2011 I quit my day-job to focus on [my startup](http://www.sidebox.com) and diving into freelancing and entrepreneurship. About two years ago I decided to go back and finish my degree. In June of 2012, I graduated with honors with a BS degree in Software Engineering from The University of Phoenix.

In 2010 I co-founded <a href="http://www.sidebox.com">SideBox</a> with my business partner Barry Harkness. SideBox is a company focused on building tools for the small service industry. In 2011, we built and launched <a href="http://servicepros.nreabynow.co">Nearby Now</a>, a mobile toolset designed to help small businesses increase sales, drive more visitors to their website, and get more customer reviews.

##Now

In 2013, I join the team at <a href="http://www.lessneglect">Less Neglect</a> to help them build an amazing customer analytics platform.

I enjoy working on these fun projects like [Pay Pad for Stripe](https://www.pay-pad.com), [Alerts for Stripe](https://www.pay-pad.com/alerts), and [Tekfolio](http://www.tekfolio.me).
