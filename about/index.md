This is the personal site of Billy Coover - software engineer, entrepreneur, and sports nut. I build desktop, web, and mobile applications.

##Background

From mid 2005, through now, I've been building award winning enterprise desktop, mobile, and web applications. In April of 2011 I quit my day-job to focus on [my startup](http://www.nearbynow.co) and diving into freelancing and entrepreneurship. About two years ago I decided to go back and finish my degree. In June of 2012, I graduated with honors with a BS degree in Software Engineering from The University of Phoenix.

In 2010 I co-founded [Nearby Now](http://www.nearbynow.co). Nearby Now is a company focused on helping small businesses increase sales, drive more visitors to their website, and get more good customer reviews.

In 2013, I joined the team at [Less Neglect](http://www.lessneglect) to help them build an amazing customer analytics platform.

##Now

When I have some downtime from Nearby Now, I work on Pay [Pay Pad for Stripe](https://www.pay-pad.com), the best iOS app for managing your [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) account.
