This is the personal site of Billy Coover - software engineer, entrepreneur, and sports nut. I build desktop, web, and mobile applications for businesses of all sizes. You can view my [Tekfolio](http://www.tekfolio.me/billy) to see some of my recent work.

##Background

From mid 2005, through now, I've been building award winning enterprise desktop, mobile, and web applications. In April of 2011 I quit my day-job to focus on [my startup](http://www.sidebox.com) and diving into freelancing and entrepreneurship. About two years ago I decided to go back and finish my degree. In June of 2012, I graduated with honors with a BS degree in Software Engineering from The University of Phoenix.

In 2010 I co-founded <a href="http://www.sidebox.com">SideBox</a> with my business partner Barry Harkness. SideBox is a company focused on building tools for the small service industry. In 2011, we built and launched <a href="http://servicepros.nreabynow.co">Nearby Now</a>, a mobile toolset designed to help small businesses increase sales, drive more visitors to their website, and get more customer reviews.

##Now 

I currently split my time between .NET contracting and building SideBox and Nearby Now. At SideBox I'm responsible for:  

- Development of our web, iOS, Android, and WordPress products  
- Quality assurance  
- Keeping multiple web and database servers (data centers and AWS) up, running, and patched  
- Business development, marketing, and advertising  
- Accounting/AP/AR  
- Customer service  

I enjoy working on these fun projects like [Pay Pad for Stripe](https://www.pay-pad.com), [Alerts for Stripe](https://www.pay-pad.com/alerts), [Tekfolio](http://www.tekfolio.me), and [The Fit Menu](http://www.thefitmenu.com).

##Availability
I get emails and phone solicitations on occasion from startups and businesses hoping to recruit me. I'm humbled by this. I am fully committed to SideBox and Nearby Now which means I can't commit to a day job.
