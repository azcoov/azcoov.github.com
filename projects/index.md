# Projects

Once in a blue moon, I get a chance to hack on things. I'll list them here for your viewing pleasure.

### [BudgetBar](http://www.tekfolio.me/billy/portfolio/budget%20bar)

I'm in love with [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com) and the simple little graphs they use to represent the health of a budget. 

### [jQuery Toaster](http://coovtech.com/projects/toaster)

Twitter & StackOverlow has a neat little sliding dive that drops down and provides alerts. I want one so here it is. It's used in a couple enterprise production apps. yeah.

### [BootstrapMvc](https://github.com/azcoov/BootstrapMvc)

Well, this isn't really my hack. It's my go-to template whenever I start a new asp.net mvc project. It's pre-loaded with Bootstrap, CoffeeSharp, and Dotless.

### [MvcRazorThemableViewEngine](https://github.com/azcoov/MvcRazorThemableViewEngine)

If you want an MVC site that is themable with drop-in markup, styles, javascript, and everything else, this is what you need. Simple to startup, easy to extend.
